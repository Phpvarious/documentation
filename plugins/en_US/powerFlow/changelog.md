### Improvement

- All "power" commands are automatically converted to W to simplify calculations and avoid unit errors.
- All "power" uses a unit conversion (identical to the core).<br><i>eg : 1000 W -> will display 1 kW.</i>
- Possibility to reorganize the "custom" (Sortable).

### Bugfix

- The color of the "total power" now follows the color set in the plugin (Color if value = 0 or Hide if value = 0)<br>
<i>(Unless you use the instantaneous total power command)</i>
- Added a "min" of 7px for text sizes in "customs".
